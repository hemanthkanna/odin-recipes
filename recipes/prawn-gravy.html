        <p>Eral kuzhambu (Prawn gravy) is a south Indian style gravy made with small prawns, coconut masala and basic spices. This prawn gravy goes well with rice, dosa and uthappam.
    
            I used medium-sized raw prawns to make this Eral kuzhambu. Medium or small prawn or shrimp is always tasty and the best choice for spicy prawn preparations.</p>

            <li>Crush 2 small tomatoes into a paste and keep aside. Grind 3tbsp coconut with a tsp of fennel seeds, cumin seeds and peppercorns each. Keep aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 3tbsp of oil, season with a tsp of mustard seeds and half a tsp of fennel. Wait till the mustard seeds splutter and add a cup of chopped shallots or onions. Saute 3mins until onions become brown and soft</li>
            <li>Add 2 tsp of ginger garlic paste and saute well for few minutes until the raw smell of ginger garlic leaves. Next, add the ground tomatoes and cook 4mins till tomato leaves oil.</li>
