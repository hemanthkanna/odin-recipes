      <h2 class="sub-title">Ambur-Mutton-Biryani</h2>
      <p>Ambur mutton biryani is a famous biryani variety popularly known as Ambur star briyani, in which mutton pieces are cooked tenderly with minimal spices and unique method.
          This Ambur style of preparation is very much unique, which is followed in the famous biryani outlet “Star Briyani”.        
        <br>  
          This is the method followed by Arcot chefs for royal Nawab families during the earlier days around the area of Ambur and Vaniyambadi in Vellore district. And it became so popular around the world. As the people who prepare this biryani specifically mention, in this particular method we should never use ghee and green chillies like other varieties of biryani.
        <br>
          This method involves a dum process for which they use a large charcoal filled type of wood log stoves and that gives an excellent slow-cooked aroma as well as tenderness to the meat. As a special mention, I would like to say that the rice variety used in this Ambur Star Mutton briyani is seeraga samba(as called in South) which is commonly known as jeera rice.</p>
